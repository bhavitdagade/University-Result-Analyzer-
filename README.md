University Result Analyzer 

Developed "University Result Analyzer" . Pune University(SPPU) sends  a PDF file containg result of all the students of particular department  to all engineering colleges under University, so I built an system which will extract all the data from PDF  file using "pyPDF2" library in python3 and do the following functions. 
1)Segregate passed and failed student in a semester.
2)Show overall toppers and subject toppers.
3)Number of students  passed and failed in particular subject. 
4)Total Result of Subject and Average Score of Subject.
which would eventually automate the process and stop the tedious task done by result coordinator of Department.
